## Library of functions used to install and launch games. Installed
## games are expected to be in $GAMEDIR (above). Launching will look
## for two environment variables:

##   $PROGDIR - The first-level subdirectory of $GAMEDIR
##   $LAUNCH  - The name of the executable (can include additional subdirs)

## If the file is found:
##   * If it is executable, it will be launched.
##   * If it is a Java .jar file, it will be launched with java
## In both cases STDOUT will be captured in $LOGFILE (above), written
## to $PROGDIR. Additional run variables:
##   * $PRERUN  : Will show before running program
##   * $POSTRUN : Will show after running

## If the launcher is not found, then the installer directory
## $INSTROOT (above) will be checked to see if the instal file
## $INSTNAME can be found in directory $INSTDIR. If those variables
## are set and the installer is found:
##   * If it is a .sh it will be run
##   * If a zip/bz2/bzip2 it will be extracted
## Additional installation variables
##   * $INSTRENAME : set to "foo/bar", will try to rename 'foo' to 'bar'
##                   The 'from' part can contain '*' wildcards
##   * $INSTAPT    : will show the contents as suggested libraries
##   * $INSTHELP   : will suggest contents as installation help source
##   * INSTSAVEDIR : will be moved to Documents/GameFiles then symlinked
##   * INSTICON    : custom icon file name (basename)
